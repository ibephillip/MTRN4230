Some basics with git

1. Always make changes in a new BRANCH (or your working branch)

2. PULL from master and merge with your branch to see if there are any updates 
	
	a. Make sure you are working with the latest version of each file

3. Commit and PUSH your changes to Your branch 
	
	a. Essentially saving locally and online

4. Submit a PULL REQUEST (which merges yours into master) 
	
	a. We can verify that the changes are correct before overwriting master
